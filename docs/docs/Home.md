The Wishlist — a product of The Wishlist Co — provides stores with a hosted wishlist solution that can be shared between their brick-and-mortar stores and online storefronts.
The initial implementation of The Wishlist provides integration with Shopify online storefronts, although additional solutions will be added later.

This documentation focuses on the integration with Shopify.

## Accessing the Shopify configuration for The Wishlist

The steps below show how to access the wishlist configuration for your Shopify store.

1. Log into your Shopify store.
2. In the menu on the left-hand-side of the page, select the “Apps” item.
3. A small popup will be displayed showing the list of applications that have been installed in your online store. Select “Wishlist”.
4. You will then be taken to your wishlist account, which will also require you to log in.

At this point, you should see an administration page for the wishlist. It can be used to configure the wishlist experience that your Shopify customers will see.

The menu items in your wishlist configuration include:

- [[Dashboard]] — provides an overall summary of your customer's wishlist use.
- [[Subscription]] — use this option to manage your subscription to the wishlist.
