The core of the configuration work required for The Wishlist is accessible from the “App Configurations” menu.

From here, you can configure:
- how the wishlist is [launched](app-configuration-launch-point.md) in your shop;
- the way a customer can [add articles](app-configuration-add-items-to-wishlist.md) to their wishlist;
- the look and feel of the [wishlist page](app-configuration-wishlist-page.md) that the customer sees; and
- the different [email notifications](app-configuration-notifications.md) that a customer can receive.

## A note on saving your changes…

Whenever you've made a change to the wishlist application configuration, you need to ensure you click the `Save` button to persist those changes. You can also reset to the default settings if you've gone down a path that you're not happy with and want to start again.

These buttons are both in the bottom-right corner of each configuration page.
