# [[App Configurations]]

The core of the configuration work required for The Wishlist is accessible from the “App Configurations” menu.

From here, you can configure:
- how the wishlist is [[App Configuration — Launch Point|launched]] in your shop;
- the way a customer can [[App Configuration — Add Items to Wishlist|add articles]] to their wishlist;
- the look and feel of the [[App Configuration — Wishlist Page|wishlist page]] that the customer sees; and
- the different [[App Configuration — Notifications|email notifications]] that a customer can receive.

## A note on saving your changes…

Whenever you've made a change to the wishlist application configuration, you need to ensure you click the `Save` button to persist those changes. You can also reset to the default settings if you've gone down a path that you're not happy with and want to start again.

These buttons are both in the bottom-right corner of each configuration page.
