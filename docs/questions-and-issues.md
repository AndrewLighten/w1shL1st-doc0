|  #  | Question                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Answer |
|:---:| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
|  1  | On `Add Items to Wishlist` → `Product Detail Page` → `Configuration button position`, how does a custom JS positioning script work?                                                                              |        |
|  2  | Explain `Before user has added to their cart` on the `Wishlist Page` → `Add to Cart Button` page.                                                                                                                    |        |
|  3  | In the `Desktop` and `Mobile` styles (several places), what's the size break between them?                                                                                                                           |        |
|  4  | On `Wishlist Page` → `Multiple Wishlists`, where is that message shown?                                                                                                                                              |        |
|  5  | If a customer has multiple wishlists, and you then turn that off, the customer loses access to those wishlists. Will those now inaccessible wishlists still trigger notifications (e.g., low stock, reminders, etc)? |        |
|  6  | How does the email/social media sharing of wishlists work? Can the format and style be customised?                                                                                                                   |        |
|  7  | I don't seem to get email for downloaded reports. Is this a bug, or something I've done wrong? What does that downloaded data look like?                                                                             |        |

|  1  | On `Wishlist Page` → `Add to Cart Button`, the text “`Upload your customize icon`” should be “`Upload your custom icon`”      |
|  2  | I think `Wishlist Page` → `Default Wishliost Name` and →  `Multiple Wishlist` should be one section. They're tightly related. |
